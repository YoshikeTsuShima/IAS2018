## IAS2018
A web site presenting topics related to IT and Society, done by S4 ICT students of EEB2 in school year 2017-2018.

#### To show the site in a browser:
https://eeb2.github.io/IAS2018

## Requirements:
- Every team creates a topic-specific folder to manage the files related to the topic.
- Create an `index.html` file in your folder. This is the main page of your topic.
- Every team creates a CSS file to change the look of the topic pages. Name it `styles_X.css` where X is replaced by your topic name (or its shorthand expression).
- Present your topic in a simple and understandable way. Divide it into logical parts and make the site structure accordingly.
- Write your own text. Don't copy-and-paste text without a good reason - and in that case mark the source immediately. *Note: if you don't understand a word or an expression, don't use it! Write the idea in other words or leave it out.*
- Linking: you must be able to easily navigate between the pages in your topic folder. Preserve the link to the home of homes, too.
- Sources: make a separate HTML page to list the sources (give the links, too).
- Copyright: make sure you are allowed to use the images and other materials and follow the given source marking recommendations.
